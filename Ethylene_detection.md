##Introduction
- **Ethylene** : Gaseous ripening ***phytohormone*** for fruits and plants, primarily measured with stationary equipments in laboratories.

- **Issues** : 
1.Lack of portable units
2.High humidity inside controlled atmosphere

- Three potentially promising measurement principles
**1.Non dispersive infrared spectroscopy
2.Miniaturized gas chromatography
3.Electrochemical measurement**

- Above measurement princibles compared *w.r.t* fruits logistics
**1.Sensitivity
2.Selectivity
3.Long Term Stability
4.Facilitation of automated measurement
5.Suitability for mobile applications**

- Systems costs around 10,000 euros.

##Ethylene measurement for quality fruit monitoring
####1.Photoacoustic Spectroscopy
- Provides highest sensitivity values to ethylene gas
- **Method** : Laser beam polarized and chopped in specific frequency. Based on chemical structure, specific gas compound absorbs light light at specific wavelenght. Gas periodically heated according to copping frequency. Pressure changes caused by temperature changes measured by microphone. 
- **Result** : Photoacoustic amplitude rises with concentration of specific gas component. 
- **Disadvantage** : Price, inherent sensitivity towards ambient noise and vibration added to humidity, temperature.
