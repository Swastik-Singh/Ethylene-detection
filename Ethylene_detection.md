##Introduction
- **Ethylene** : Gaseous ripening ***phytohormone*** for fruits and plants, primarily measured with stationary equipments in laboratories.

- **Issues** : 
1.Lack of portable units
2.High humidity inside controlled atmosphere

- Three potentially promising measurement principles
**1.Non dispersive infrared spectroscopy
2.Miniaturized gas chromatography
3.Electrochemical measurement**

- Above measurement princibles compared *w.r.t* fruits logistics
**1.Sensitivity
2.Selectivity
3.Long Term Stability
4.Facilitation of automated measurement
5.Suitability for mobile applications**

- Systems costs around 10,000 euros.

##Ethylene measurement for quality fruit monitoring
####1.Photoacoustic Spectroscopy

| 1            | [Photoacoustic spectroscopy of CO2 laser in the detection of gaseous molecules](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/274/1/012086/meta) | In this work, a photoacoustic laser spectrometer with CO2 emission in the infrared range and a resonant photoacoustic cell was used. The resonance frequency of 2.4 kHz to photoacoustic cell, was estimated detection limit of the spectrometer ethylene, 16 ppbV was obtained|



- Provides highest sensitivity values to ethylene gas
- **Method** : Laser beam polarized and chopped in specific frequency. Based on chemical structure, specific gas compound absorbs light light at specific wavelenght. Gas periodically heated according to copping frequency. Pressure changes caused by temperature changes measured by microphone. 
- **Result** : Photoacoustic amplitude rises with concentration of specific gas component. 
- **Disadvantage** : Price, inherent sensitivity towards ambient noise and vibration added to humidity, temperature.
